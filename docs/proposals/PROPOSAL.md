# Website Project Proposal — Cape Flats Youth Football Foundation (CFYFF)

**Organisation overview**  
CFYFF is a community NPO that runs after‑school football and mentorship programmes in Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha. It offers coaching, life‑skills workshops and weekend leagues for boys and girls (8–18). Audiences: local parents/guardians, potential volunteers and Cape Town–based donors/sponsors.

**Goals & objectives**  
• Recruit volunteers and mentors; increase monthly donors.  
• Publish fixtures, results and photos to keep families engaged.  
• Capture enquiries for player registration and sponsorships.  
**KPIs:** volunteer sign‑ups/month; new donors/month; donation value; player registration enquiries; newsletter sign‑ups; time on site.

**Current presence**  
No official website (social media only). Strengths: active photos and community proof. Weaknesses: scattered info, no donation funnel, no schedule archive, poor SEO and discoverability.

**Features & structure**  
Pages: Home, About (mission, team, safeguarding), Programmes (training, leagues, mentorship), Get Involved (volunteer/donate), News/Fixtures, Contact. Enquiry form (volunteer/mentor/sponsor options with auto‑response after validation); contact form; fixtures/results table; gallery with lightbox; Google Map to fields; newsletter sign‑up. Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt text, labels, visible focus.

**Design & UX**  
Warm community palette (greens/yellows), clear CTAs (“Volunteer”, “Donate”, “Register”). Mobile‑first layout, card sections, readable fonts and strong heading hierarchy. Low‑fi wireframes for Home, Programmes, Get Involved.

**Technical requirements**  
HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS. Hosting: .co.za domain + basic shared/static hosting with SSL (Let’s Encrypt). JS for accordion FAQs, gallery lightbox and client‑side form validation. SEO: page‑specific titles/descriptions, structured headings, internal links, sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
